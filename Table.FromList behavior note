This is a note from something I learned today that took me a while to understand:

the function Table.FromList() by default if comas are present in the the elements of the list for example {"Hello, world" , "This is a , test"} it will apply splitterbydelimiter(",") by default, 
which will return a table table of 2 columns with 2 rows , if the comas are not present then it will return a single column with 4 rows, this only happens with comas.

see code for examples:

let
    myList = { "Apple, Banana", "Carrot, Orange" },

    // Default behavior (apply splitbydelimiter function because the text in the list contains comas )
    defaultSplit = Table.FromList(myList),

    // Explicit no-split when comas present 
    noSplit = Table.FromList(myList, Splitter.SplitByNothing()) ,

    // Custom delimiter example (splitting on "/")
    customList = { "Apple/Banana", "Carrot/Orange" },
    splitBySlash = Table.FromList(customList, Splitter.SplitTextByDelimiter("/"))
in
    splitBySlash
